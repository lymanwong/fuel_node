# fuel_inventory_checker
My hack-a-thon project.
Issue: We are currently sending users to an api where they can search for inventory https://api.scalablepress.com/v2/products/gildan-cotton-t-shirt/availability
This is a poor experience.

Goal: I decided to create a responsive, user-friendly app where users can easily look through the data.

This app is made with:
Node
Express
Bootstrap
jQuery
Ajax
Html/CSS

Note: Created a redirect to send users to the new Fuel app.

1) Open your Terminal app
2) Navigate to the app folder
3) Type "npm start" and hit Enter
4) Open a browser and type "localhost:5000"
